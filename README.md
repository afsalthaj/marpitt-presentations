# marpitt-presentations

Great way to make your presentations nicer. 
Thanks to [marpit](https://github.com/marp-team/marpit).
I have always been a big fan of it to create nice looking presentation slides from markdowns.

This project just handles the ceremony of setting up things to quick start creating presentations with marpitt.
Consider this as a simple template for you.

```
git clone this project
cd mrpitt-presentations
npm install
npm start !

```

If things didn't fall in place, try out these commands for marpitt.

```
yarn add @marp-team/marpit

```

or

```
npm install @marp-team/marpit --save
```

To include your markdown, open marpit.js in this project, and you will know the rest.
Add your contents, and do `npm start`
