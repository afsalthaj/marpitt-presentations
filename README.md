# marpitt-presentations

Great way to make your presentations nicer. 
Thanks to marpit, always been a big fan of markdown as ppts.

I will be adding my own contents here for the presentations in my workplace. 
Consider this as a template for you.

```
git clone this project
cd mrpitt-presentations
npm install
npm start !

```

If things didn't fall in place, try out these commands for marpitt.

```
yarn add @marp-team/marpit

```

or

```
npm install @marp-team/marpit --save


```

To create your own markdowns as presentation htmls, move to marpit.js in this project, and include your markdown, and it will work!
